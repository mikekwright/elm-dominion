Elm Dominion
==================================================

I love the card game dominion, so this is my attempt to create a version of this
game that is written using [elm](http://elm-lang.org)   

## First project

So this is my first time creating a project of this sort, but I am excited to be
using elm.  I'm a huge fan of functional programming, and love web development so
I figured this guy would be tons of fun (I also love the card game Dominion).   

Since this was my first project I used a guide that layed out the structure found
[here](http://blog.jessitron.com/2015/11/getting-off-ground-in-elm-project-setup.html)    

## Design



## Testing



## Hosting



## Items to mark while learning

1. [Elm Package](http://package.elm-lang.org/)
